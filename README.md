## Overview of PyBer Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how PyBer is doing in each city type by cleaning the data through groupbys, loc and pivot tables to then produce a story that can be understood by others using a chart.      

## Results:
**PyBer summary including all three types of cities:**
